## Running and Testing
Compile the code by typing <code>make</code> into the linux terminal while in the lab_intro directory.
This builds the execuatable <code>treefun</code>, which can be used to run the <code>main</code> function by typing <code>./treefun</code> into the terminal.
Adding <code>color</code> as a modifier after the executable colors the branches of the tree green if they are correct or red if they are wrong.
This mode might cause unexpected issues when debugging so be cautious.
The provided test cases can be run by typing <code>make test</code> and then <code>./test</code> into the terminal.
Keep in mind that some test cases may produce different results on different computers.
